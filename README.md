# Kickstarter Funding  

## Background

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. 

### Objective

A database of 4000 past Kickstarter projects has been studied and analyzed using excel, in order to uncover any hidden market trends.

### Conclusions

  * With the data provided and from the above visualizations, it can be concluded that Theater is the most successful category for kickstarter campaigns, followed by music and Film & Video categories. 
  * Coming to the sub-categories, plays seem to be the most popular followed by rock music.
  * Similarly, campaigns started in the month of May seem to be the most successful, and the gap between successful and failed campaigns seems to narrow down since then until December.
  * Also, most of these campaigns seem to be located in United States followed by Great Britain and Canada.
  * Success rate per country, Success vs Failure rate per category, number of backers for successful and failed campaigns per category are some of the other possible tables and/or graphs that we could further explore/look into.
 
 However the dataset provided is not complete and may not be representative of the whole picture, given the small sample size.
